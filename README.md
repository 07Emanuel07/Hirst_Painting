# Hirst Painting Project

This Python application utilizes the `turtle` module to create a colorful dot painting inspired by the works of Damien Hirst. 
The application generates a grid of colored dots based on a predefined color palette, allowing users to create visually appealing artwork programmatically.

## Key Features

**Color Palette:**
  - The application uses a predefined list of RGB color tuples to create the dots. This color palette is inspired by the vibrant colors often used in Hirst's artwork.

**Turtle Graphics:**
  - The project utilizes the `turtle` module to create a graphical window where users can see the dots being drawn. The turtle moves around the screen to create the dot pattern.

**Grid of Dots:**
  - The application generates a grid of dots, with each dot being randomly colored from the predefined color palette. The dots are arranged in a structured manner, creating a visually appealing pattern.
